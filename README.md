XCom2 Mod Manager for OSX
----

![Screenshot](/docs/screenshot.png "Screenshot")

If you have XCom2 for OSX, you might have noticed that the builtin mod manager takes forever to boot and crashes a lot.

This is an attempt to simplify enabling/disabling mods. Simply start this mod manager and check/uncheck mods to immediately enable/disable them in your mod config.

Assumes you are using Steam Workshop to manage your mod subscriptions/downloads; this only enables/disables them locally.

This has been tested on my machine only; source is included.

Releases

Requires [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/download/) to build for yourself.

[The latest release can be found here](https://github.com/scally/xcom2-mod-manager/releases).

You may have to delete the old version before reinstalling a new version; the installer seems hesistant to install over itself for reasons I have yet to understand.

Caveats
---

It seems that there's been some kind of hotfix that re-enables all installed mods each time you boot the game. I've worked around it for now by setting the file to readonly after we write the list of enabled mods.
